## Overview

The Simple Authentication System provides a straightforward way to manage user authentication securely. It allows users to register and log in using hashed passwords, enhancing security against unauthorized access. This project emphasizes secure coding practices and the importance of protecting user data.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Secure storage of user credentials
- Basic input validation
- Simple user interface

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Bcrypt**: A password hashing function that is computationally intensive, making it difficult for attackers to crack passwords.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework for building web applications in Java.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing user data.

## Installation

To set up the Simple Authentication System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saishivanipaladugu/Simple-Authentication-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Simple-Authentication-System
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. Configure the database connection in `application.properties`.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. The default URL is `http://localhost:8080`. Here, you can register a new user or log in with existing credentials.

1. **Register a New User**: Fill in the registration form with a username and password. The password will be hashed using bcrypt before being stored.

2. **Login**: Enter your username and password to log in. The system will verify the credentials against the stored hashed password.

3. **Security**: The application ensures that user passwords are never stored in plain text, enhancing overall security.
